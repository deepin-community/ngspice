 Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to
 be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
 To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
 terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in

     Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
     otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright
     and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
     License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or

     essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
 d.  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
     related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
     broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without
     regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this
     Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not
     Copyright and Similar Rights.
 e.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
     of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
     obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on
     December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
 f.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.
 g.  License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a
     Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public
     License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
 h.  Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
     material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
 i.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
     conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
     Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that
     the Licensor has authority to license.
 j.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
     Public License.
 k.  Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process thati
     requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
     public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
     communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
     public including in ways that members of the public may access the
     material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
 l.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
     from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
     March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
     succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
     world.
 m.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
     this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
 a.  License grant.
     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
        Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
        and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply,
        and you do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
        whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
        to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
        modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
        Measures.  For purposes of this Public License, simply making
        modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
        Material.
     5. Downstream recipients.
         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
            Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
            to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
            this Public License.
         B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every
            recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
            offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
            Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You
            apply.
         C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
            additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
            Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
            so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of
            the Licensed Material.
     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
        endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
        designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b.  Other rights.
     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
        this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
        waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor
        to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
        Rights, but not otherwise.
     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
        waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
        the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
 a.  Attribution.
     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
        must:
         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
            Licensed Material:
          i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
             others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
             requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
         ii. a copyright notice;
        iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
         iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
          v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
             reasonably practicable;
         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
            indication of any previous modifications; and
         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
            License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
            Public License.
     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
        Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
        conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
        the required information.
     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
        required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
 .
 b.  ShareAlike.
     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
     Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
     1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with
        the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible
        License.
     2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's
        License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
        Adapted Material.
     3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
        conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,
        Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the
        Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
 Your use of the Licensed Material:
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
    extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database;
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
    in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
    contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
    and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
    Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
    includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
    known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
 b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
    any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
    for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
    exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
    this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
    has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
    damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in
    part, this limitation may not apply to You.
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
    closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
    Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
    License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
    automatically.
 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
       cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
    the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
    Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
    Public License.
 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
    Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
    and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
