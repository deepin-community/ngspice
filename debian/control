Description: Spice circuit simulator
 NGSpice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator.  Its code is based on
 three open source software packages:
 Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice. It supports compiled Verilog-A models through
 the built-in OSDI interface.
 .
 NGSpice is part of gEDA project, a full GPL'd suite of Electronic Design
 Automation tools.

Description: Spice circuit simulator - development files for ngspice and tclspice
 NGSpice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator. Its code is based on
 three open source software packages:
 Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice. It supports compiled Verilog-A models through
 the built-in OSDI interface.
 .
 Use this package in case you need to compile own Xspice models as a dynamic
 library with a file extension *.cm. Those files need to be placed into
 /usr/lib/$(multiarch)/ngspice and will be loaded by the ngspice executable.
 .
 This package contains the development header files for libspice and own
 ngspice dynamic library models.

Description: NGSpice library for Tcl
 This package provides the NGSpice simulation engine for your Tcl-scripts by the
 library libspice.
 All spice directives are available as Tcl functions and it features some new
 commands that are useful for the integration into the Tcl environment. It
 includes Xspice. It supports also compiled Verilog-A models through the
 built-in OSDI interface.
 GUI is handled by Tk using BLT vectors.
