    Using this configure option in the base variable for all configuration

    for now we can prevent this issue by only using --with-editline for the

  * [0764715] ngspice-dev.install.in: adjust sequencer file
    Upstream isn't installing quite any header for ngspice-dev any more as

  * [1cbcc55] d/gbp.conf: update import filter, more files to ignore
    Upstream has changed the shipped files and folders, we need to filter out

    we anyway had never shipped within the packaging.

  * [9de06e7] rebuild patch queue from patch-queue branch
    added patches:
    fixes/spelling-fixing-some-misspelled-words.patch
    fixes/spelling-fixing-more-misspelled-words.patch
    reproducible/Allow-one-to-override-build-date.patch

    removed patch (obsolete / adopted upstream):
    01_fix_manpages.patch
    02_fix_tcl_examples.patch
  * [656c866] debian/control: remove reference to non-free
    With the DFSG compatible source the source package don't need to get into
    no-free.
  * [012b1e4] move maintainership over to Debian Electronics Team
    After some conversations about the future maintainer-ship of ngspice Gudjon
    I. Gudjonsson and Andreas Tille agreed on the movement to the Debian
    Electronics group.
    Of course I want to thank all people who spend their time on doing any
    maintaining work in ngspice!
  * [5e04896] libngspice0-dev.install.in: update header install
    The libngspice-dev package is only containing one header file and it's gonna
    installed into the typical folder for public headers.
  * [8b7ecb6] libngspice0-dev: small change to the description
    Adding a small suffix to the short description so it's better visible about
    the use case for this package.
  * [44b2625] manpages: drop no longer needed local hold manpages
    The manpages are included in the upstream source since version 27. No need
    to ship them inside Debian anymore.
  * [4ce54e5] ngspice: drop --with-editline in favor of --with-readline
    (Closes: #834247)
  * [5aa3be1] debian/rules: update helper and targets for build
    The build of the source requires three stages (as for ngspice, libngspice
    and tclspice) of configuring and building as some configure options are
    prohibitive each other.
    Creating dedicated variables with such configure options which are used
    later in the dh_auto_configure target.
  * [fa60633] debian/control: update tclspice package
    The tclspice package is mainly providing a shared library which is depending
    on same ngspice package version.
    Rephrase a bit the package description. And the fields 'Replace" and
    "Breaks" on the tclspice-dev package isn't needed anymore.
  * [1683ca1] ngspice-dev: adding new binary package
    By creating libngspice-dev with it's own required header file and the
    dropping of the installation of the other header files in the ngspice
    package we need to create a new -dev package for ngspice.
    This is fulfilled by this new package ngspice-dev which includes the
    remaining header files and the dev link of libspice0.so.
  * [2c72a25] ngspice: adopt needed changes to the install sequence
    The install sequence for the ngspice package is depending on Multi-Arch
    related content which need to substitute content while package build. Thus
    we turn the install file into a install.in file.
  * [8adb653] d/ngspice.links: linking COPYING to GPL-2 license file
  * [4de4e42] ngspice-dev.install: adding dh sequence for ngspice-dev
    The source of the libspice0.so link is related to Multi-Arch folders. Like
    for ngspice-dev we create the ngspice-dev.install dynamically while running
    the build.
  * [f32a16e] tclspice: rework dh helper sequencer
    Also the tclspice package is containing Multi-Arch related paths and some
    changed install folders opposite to the previous packaging which requires
    the usage of a install.in file.
  * [dfb5011] tclspice.symbols: adding a symbols file for libspice
  * [d75e230] debian/watch: update watch file
    Update to version 4.
  * [c068f36] debian/README.source: adding some notes about the source
    Adding some historical facts about the evolving of NGSpice and remarks about
    the way to DFSG compatible source.
  * [706d04b] debian/README.source: add note about VCS for ngspice
    The source package of ngspice is using git-buildpackage for package
    management.
  * [574b7f8] ngspice: adjust install sequencer
    Adjust the sequencer as the folder 'helpdir' isn't shipped anymore.
  * [7c46255] d/rules: adding new target override_dh_install-indep
    The documentation, which is build from an additional tarball, can be build
    and should be build architecture independently. This requires the usage of
    a dedicated target for the documentation and modifications to the existing
    targets which need to be now architecture specific.
  * [a37ef8c] ngspice-doc: adjust package after source is now DFSG
    Now that also the documentation is DSFG compatible the control section about
    this package needs adjustments like the Section and the containing elements.
    Also adjusting some related debhelper sequencing files.
    (Closes: #826873)
  * [5c1ca0a] d/control: Update Vcs URLs to Salsa
  * [788ca8d] d/control: drop duplicated Priority fields
    As the source package is already marked with Priority 'optional' we don't
    need the same Priority within some binary packages.
  * [a314f7e] d/rules: don't run the auto_test target for now
    We will ignore the auto tests for now, they will be enabled later again.
  * [b382cbf] copyright: adding some cme script helper
    The cme helper script can help to collect all license information in an
    effective way, but this needs some additional helper files. Adding those
    files by this commit.
  * [57e3819] d/copyright: update the copyright information
    The debian/copyright file needs a complete rework which is done based an
    the output of the cme helper script.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * [5fd383a] Install pkg-config file
    The dh sequencer was missing also the installation of the pkg-config file
    for ngspice.
  * [70417b8] autopkgtest: make sure we can link against libngspice0
    Adding a autopkg test so we can check the possibility of linking against
    libngspice0.
  * [9b72171] Don't hardcode doc package version
    Use the package source version for the suggested version of ngspice-doc in
    ngspice.

  [ Carsten Schoenert ]
  * [5f71810] Remove file README.Debian
    Currently we don't need this README file anymore.
  * [230fbc0] ngspice.lintian-overrides: adding small overrides
  * [a40eeea] tclspice.lintian-overrides: add override for libspice0
  * [6989e30] install example scripts for testbenchs again
