The manual for ngspice-44 is here!

Since ngspice-21, we provide an elaborate manual.
It's source is a lyx file plus tables and pictures, it's standard
distribution is a pdf file. A xhtml version may be compiled as well.
The manual actually uses Lyx 2.3.7 as its text processor, and
Tex Live 2024 for background data.
