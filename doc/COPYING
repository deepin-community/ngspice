Foreword:
The name "Spice" was originally chosen at the University of California, Berkeley. 
As it is the basis of almost all circuit simulators, the major part of the 
analogue and mixed signals simulation code is designed to fit with it. 
The *spices (generic name for its forks) are heterogeneous in many points due
to the work of researchers, electronic designers, software editors, etc.
The Ngspice team has collected work from the different sources and then
contributes new functionalities. Thus, the material we manipulate is 
heterogeneous in licenses, as reflected by the license for the ngspice manual.
